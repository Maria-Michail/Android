A planning app that you can put your schedule.

Reason: I like organization

A home page with the today’s date, and underneath a list of plans with time on the left, the title of the plan, swiping on the right to show options to delete, 
and click on the plan to mark it as done which shows a tick on the right. There is a floating action to add a new plan. 
Click left or right takes you to the previous or next page.
A bar on the top with a title, on the right a calendar icon to overlook the whole month, and a hamburger that you can click to get a navigation drawer on the side. 
The navigation bar has the home page, the calendar page, and the deadlines list.
The calendar page has the whole month, each day in separate cell. 
By clicking one cell it opens detailed page of that day. Swipe left or right goes to previous or next month.
Adding a plan is a page with title, date, time, deadline or not and add button.
Deadline page has all deadlines one after the other with date for each.
